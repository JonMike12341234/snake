- Use the **Arrow Keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.

**Objective:**
- The main goal is to eat the red food blocks that appear on the screen.
- Each piece of food eaten makes the snake grow longer and increases your score.
- Avoid running into the walls of the game area or colliding with the snake's own tail. If you do, the game is over!
